# Implementation Plan: Transaction Operations

**Branch**: `[unassigned]` | **Date**: 2026-06-25 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)

**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/005-transaction-operations/spec.md`

## Summary

Deliver transaction operations for deposits, withdrawals, transfers, and history retrieval with strong consistency for balance updates, no-overdraft enforcement, idempotent monetary request handling, immutable audit records, and hybrid RBAC scope controls.

## Technical Context

| Dimension | Decision |
|---|---|
| Language/Version | Java 21 (backend), JavaScript ES2022 (frontend) |
| Backend Framework | Spring Boot 3.x (Web, Data JPA, Validation, Security) |
| Frontend Framework | React 18 + React Query v5 + Axios + Vite |
| Storage | Runtime: MySQL; local development and test execution: H2 |
| Testing (backend) | JUnit 5, Mockito |
| Testing (frontend) | Jest, React Testing Library |
| Build (backend) | Maven (pom.xml) |
| Build (frontend) | Vite + npm / package.json |
| Target Platform | Linux server (backend), modern browser (frontend) |
| Monetary Precision | BigDecimal scale=2, single system currency |
| Security | JWT Bearer token on all endpoints, RBAC permission enforcement, ownership authorization per resource |
| Project Type | Web service (backend) + Web application (frontend) |

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- Constitution file currently contains placeholders only and no enforceable project principles.
- Gate result (pre-research): PASS.

```

**Structure Decision**: Use a dedicated transaction module under `backend/src/api/transactions` with service boundaries for posting operations (deposit/withdraw/transfer), idempotency handling, balance update consistency controls, and history query composition.

## Post-Design Constitution Check

- Phase 1 artifacts align with the current placeholder constitution and contain no explicit violations.
- Gate result (post-design): PASS.

## Complexity Tracking

No constitution violations requiring justification.
